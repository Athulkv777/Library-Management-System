# Library-Management-System
Library Database Management System Project
This project involves creating and managing a database for the library. The database keeps track of all information about books in the library, including their price, status, and the total number of books available. 
This database makes use of the following tables;
Branch: Information about the different branches of the library.
Employee: Details about the employees working in the library.
Books: Contains information about the books, such as ISBN, title, category, rental price, status, author, and publisher.
Customer: Information about the customers who borrowed books from the library.
Issue Status: Tracks the status of books that have been issued to customers.
Return Status: Tracks the status of books that have been returned by customers.
A total of 12 queries are written to retrieve values from these tables for effectively managing and analysing the library's activities.
